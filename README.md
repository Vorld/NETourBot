I was tasked to organise an National Education Tour for my National Service unit of over 200 people at Labrador Park. 

We faced several challenges:
1. We didn't have enough manpower to have a guide for each team
2. Our play area was really big, making it difficult to communicate with each team separately
3. We had over 200 people to manage

I made this spaghetti Telegram bot to solve all these challenges with one solution. Yay.
